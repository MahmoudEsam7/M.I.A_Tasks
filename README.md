# **Task 2**
## Task2.1 Description:
  Designing a circuit that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V DC
  mainly it is a step-down transformar(to step-down the volt from 220V AC to 7.4V AC) and rectifier stage (it's output is pulsating dc) 
  and a filter (to kill ripples) and a zener Diode (to keep the output voltage 5V DC)
  
## Task2.2 Description :
  Designing a sample H-Bridge to control the direction of DC motor
## Task2.3 Description:
  a sample circuit which show how many parallel batteries should be connected to power the given LED for more than 5 Hours
