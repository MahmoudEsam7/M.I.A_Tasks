               C-program that takes two sensor measurements and generates only one new array measurement with any averaging method.
+ 2-HardWare
    + Lightning the Dark

          Task2.1 Description:
               Designing a circuit that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V DC
               mainly it is a step-down transformar(to step-down the volt from 220V AC to 7.4V AC) and rectifier stage (it's output is pulsating dc) 
               and a filter (to kill ripples) and a zener Diode (to keep the output voltage 5V DC)
    + Air Extractor to Fan

          Task2.2 Description :
              Designing a sample H-Bridge to control the direction of DC motor
    + Box of Shame
 
          Task2.3 Description:
              a sample circuit which show how many parallel batteries should be connected to power the given LED for more than 5 Hours
+ 3-Embedded System
    + Signal to Engage

          Task3.1 Description:
              Two Arduino codes, one that interface with two push buttons, and the other one communicates with the first one by receiving data about buttons state, using I2C                communication protocol. In the receiving side we need to interface with indicator LED andwrite a message on the Serial Monitor
    + Cookiebot

          Task3.2 Description:
              Taking data from 4 Ultrasonic sensors and try to localize the robot within well-known room ang try to get the position of an object in the same room 
+ 4-Pythin OOP & Machine Learning
    + Sky Clash

          Task4.1 Description:
              python programm which simulates a battle between two villains, each villain has the same attributes (health->100 ,energy->500) and each of them has a unique set               of weapons and shields,using the OOP features.
    + Shrrinkage Model

          Task4.2 Description:
              Create a linear regression model from skratch,using a given dataset to train this model, and plot the dataset and the model line in the same chart.
+ 5-Linux Commands      
  
      Task Description :
         it just a pdf to show how i use command lines to start with ROS. 
         The commands I used in this task :
               mkdir -> to create a direcotry.
               cd -> to change the current directory.
               catkin_make -> to create directories and run Cmake commands.
               ls -> to list directory contents of files.
               catkin_create_pkg -> to create a package.
               source devel/setup.bash -> sourcing the setup.bash files.
               chmod a+x -> to change files mode to executable.
               roscore -> to run ROS master.
               rosrun pkg_name node_name -> to run the node.
